# MAZErick

A simple online maze solving tool made on a Sunday with no motivation to do anyting else besides playing League of Legends.
The main idea came from a Python script I wrote to automate maze solving to a certain degree after four people invested time to solve a maze at the 2022 Google CTF finals (hackceler8) which in the end wasn't even needed.

## Setup

Nothing special as it's pretty standard [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) with [Mantine](https://mantine.dev) components.

## Remark

There is still lots to be optimised and cleaned up as I haven't spent much time on this project.

## Cui honorem, honorem

Thanks to [Lukas MÃ¶ller](https://github.com/lukasmoellerch) for finding an oversight with me optimising using `.fill`.
